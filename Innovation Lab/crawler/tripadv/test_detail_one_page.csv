1,Not professional,"The best way to describe Adria Airways is amateurish.I booked a return ticket between Copenhagen and Ljubljana.Later, I decided to add an extra suitcase but was not able to this on their website, and received an error message saying that because I had bought my ticket in Swedish kronor, I had to call the airline to add the baggage. This made no sense to me, but I complied with the instruction and called the airline. While on hold, I repeatedly received a message saying that the expected waiting time was ""less than 2 minutes"" but it took over an hour before I got through to someone. When I finally got through to someone, and paid for the extra luggage over the phone. Adria Airways emailed me a receipt of the transaction.Then, when I arrived at the airport and checked in, it said that my baggage allowance was 0 on the self/service machine. I went to the check in counter and they confirmed this. I had to get out the email on my phone that I received from the airline and show it, since apparently this was not in the system even though I had paid. When I arrived in Ljubljana, my baggage was one of the last to come out. I then realised that even though I am a SAS/Star Alliance Gold Member, my baggage had not been marked as priority baggage.After a pleasant week in Ljublana, which is a lovely city, I went to Ljublana Airport for my return flight to Copenhagen. The check in counter and baggage drop off did not open until 2 hours before the flight, which is unusual and good to know in case you plan to arrive at the airport early to go to the lounge. As a result I had to wait around the airport for half an hour until they opened the check in counter. And of course once again, my baggage allowance said 0 when I checked in online and I had to explain the situation with my extra suitcase at the airport. I fly frequently, as mentioned I am a SAS/Star Alliance Gold Member, and I found this experience and these hiccups to be strange. My impression is that this airline does not have its act together. On a positive note, Slovenia is a terrific country worth visiting if you have the chance!",Economy,Copenhagen,Ljubljana,Europe,July 2019,Jul 14,36,15,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
2,Worst customer experience ever,Our flights from Zurich to Ljubljana and from Ljubljana to Skopje and back had all a very big delay. Additionally on both ways we had to make a stopp im Munich because the airline combined two flights into one. Because of this the first of our three flight left 2h earlier from Zurich. Everything without any communication from the airline to passengers. We noticed only by chance. It has been my worst travel experience ever and I will for sure never fly ADRIA airways again.,Economy,Zurich,Skopje,Europe,July 2019,Jul 11,1,-1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0
3,Worst airline ever,Without mentioning the airline just add a stop-over in munich (waiting time with on- and offboarding of the passengers > 2 hours!). And this on both flights (from and to Zurich)!
